Object Oriented Programming Features
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism

1. Inheritance( Parent and child class) --Keyword = extend
2. Encapsulation = Hide the data
3. Abstraction = keep the common values in one class
4. Polymorphism = you can create multiple implementation of single values..

Inheritance (Parent and child class --Keyword = extend

Test.
1. Demo class (main)

1.Animal class
-int age;
-int runSpeed;
-String name;

--Method
-move(void)

--Child class 1. Cat 2. Dog
reuse the method and variable from super class..

Polymorphism_Intro
1. Dynamic binding( method overide)
2. Static binding(method overload)

Abstraction_Intro

- An abstract class has no use until unless it is extended by some other class.
- If you declare an abstract method in a class then you must declare the class abstract as well. you cant have abstract method in concrete class.
  Its vice versa is not always true. if a class is not having any abstract method then also it can be marked as abstract.
- it can have non- abstract method (concrete) as well.

Some basics and examples of abstract method.
1) Abstract body has no body.
2) Always ends the declaration with semicolon;
3) it must be overridden, an abstract class must be extended and in a same way abstract method must be overridden.
4) a class has to be declare abstract to have abstract methods.
